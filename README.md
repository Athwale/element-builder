### element-builder
Builder script for Element rpm.
This script most likely only works on Fedora.
I am using this script for my own personal use. If you decide to use it, you are doing it on your own.

This repository uses the same licese used by Element in their repositories:
https://github.com/vector-im
The package contains non-free media codecs which Element contains in their source code.
Icons were copied and shrunk to the correct size from https://github.com/vector-im/element-desktop/tree/develop/res/img
